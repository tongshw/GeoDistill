## üè† About

![image-20230831214545912](./assests/architecture.png)

We introduce GeoDistill, a weakly supervised selfdistillation paradigm that enhances local discriminative feature learning for robust cross-view localization. We
demonstrate that this learning paradigm applies to different localization frameworks and improves their performance by over 10% without architectural modifications.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that while FoV-based masking as a naive data augmentation
impairs performance, it significantly improves the performance of localization frameworks when applied within
our proposed teacher-student self-distillation pipeline.

## üöÄ Training

### Set up

We train and test our codes under the following environment:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- CUDA 12.0
- Python 3.8.16
- PyTorch 1.13.0

To get started, follow these steps: 

#### Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.git
cd GeoDistill
```


### Training
We released our implementation of G2SWeakly and GeoDistill with G2SWeakly both VGG and DINO variants. 

**We apply mask in both ground image and feature maps when base model is G2SWeakly, and when use CCVPE as base model, we apply mask to the descriptor.**
```bash
# to train our implemented G2SWeakly in VIGOR cross area
python -u train_vigor.py --train True --train_g2sweakly True --cross_area True


# to train orientation estimator
python -u train_orientation.py --train True --cross_area True
```

## üéâ Evaluation

### 2-DoF Evaluation

To evaluate the Geodistill model, follow these steps:

1. Download the [VIGOR](https://github.com/Jeff-Zilence/VIGOR) dataset and set its path to '/home/< usr >/Data/VIGOR'.
2. Download the [pretrained models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pPaECfpH3H1_hPc7bDbT2X7oZ5-_HyH9?usp=drive_link).
3. set 'model' in  dataset/config_vigor.json as your pth file path
4. Run the following command:

````bash
python -u train_vigor.py --train False --cross_area True
````


### 3-DoF Evaluation
set 'model' and 'orientation_model' in  dataset/config_vigor.json as your pth file path
````bash
python -u eval_3dof_vigor.py --cross_area True
````
